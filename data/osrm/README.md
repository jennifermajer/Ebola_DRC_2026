# OSRM road travel time and distance matrices

Pairwise **driving** travel times and road distances between all health zones in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), derived from zone polygons in `data/shapefiles/DRC_Health_zones.shp` and routed via the [OSRM](http://project-osrm.org/) engine (OpenStreetMap road network).

These matrices support connectivity analyses for outbreak modelling (e.g. gravity-style coupling, accessibility indices, or validation of reported movement patterns).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Files

| File | Description |
|----|----|
| `processed/osrm__travel_time__static.csv` | Origin–destination matrix of **car** travel time (minutes) |
| `processed/osrm__road_distance__static.csv` | Origin–destination matrix of **car** road distance (kilometres) |
| `process.R` | Build matrices via the public OSRM Table API |
| `metadata.yaml` | Provenance, licence, and pipeline notes |

**Dimensions:** 519 × 519 health zones (\~2.7M origin–destination pairs per matrix).\
**Coverage:** National (all zones in `DRC_Health_zones.shp`).\
**Temporal scope:** Static snapshot (single routing run; not a time series).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Method

1.  **Zones** — Load `data/shapefiles/DRC_Health_zones.shp` (519 polygons). Row and column labels use the shapefile field `Nom`, matching naming elsewhere in this repository.
2.  **Representative points** — Reproject to WGS84 (EPSG:4326) and take `st_point_on_surface()` for each polygon so the routing origin/destination lies inside the zone (centroids can fall outside irregular polygons).
3.  **Routing** — Query the public OSRM Table API (`osrm` R package, `osrm.profile = "car"`) for all pairs of representative points.
4.  **Batching** — Requests are split into 20×20 zone chunks (400 pairs per call) with a 1-second pause between batches to reduce load on the public OSRM server. Failed batches leave `NA` for the affected cells.
5.  **Export** — Square matrices are written under `processed/` with repo contract filenames (`osrm__*`).

**Units**

-   Travel time: **minutes** (as returned by the `osrm` package’s `osrmTable()` duration output).
-   Distance: OSRM returns metres; `process.R` divides by 1000 before saving (**kilometres**).

**What this is not**

-   Times and distances are **modelled road network** estimates, not observed travel data.
-   Routing uses the **car** profile only (no walking, ferry-specific, or seasonal road logic).
-   Results depend on the OSM road network underlying the public OSRM instance at the time the script was run.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## CSV format

Both processed files share the same layout:

-   **First column** (`""` in the header): origin zone name (`Nom`).
-   **Remaining columns:** destination zone names, in the same order as rows.
-   **Cell `(i, j)`:** travel time or distance from zone `i` to zone `j`.
-   **Diagonal:** `0` (same zone).
-   **Symmetry:** Times and distances are not guaranteed to be symmetric (one-way systems, turn restrictions, and OSRM’s directed graph can yield small differences); treat matrices as directed unless you explicitly symmetrise.

**Example (reading in R):**

``` r
library(here)

dur <- read.csv(here("data/osrm/processed/osrm__travel_time__static.csv"),
                row.names = 1, check.names = FALSE)
dist_km <- read.csv(here("data/osrm/processed/osrm__road_distance__static.csv"),
                    row.names = 1, check.names = FALSE)

# Travel time from "Goma" to "Beni" (minutes)
dur["Goma", "Beni"]

# Road distance from "Goma" to "Beni" (km)
dist_km["Goma", "Beni"]
```

Use `check.names = FALSE` when loading so column names are not altered. See **Limitations** if you use `row.names = 1`.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Regenerating outputs

From the **repository root** (`process.R` uses `here()`):

``` bash
Rscript data/osrm/process.R
```

**Requirements:** R packages `sf`, `dplyr`, `osrm`, `tictoc`, `here`; network access to the OSRM API.

**Runtime:** On the order of **hours** for the full country (roughly `(519 / 20)² ≈ 676` batched table calls, plus 1 s sleep per batch). Progress is printed to the console; total elapsed time is reported by `tictoc` at the end.

Outputs are overwritten under `processed/`:

-   `osrm__travel_time__static.csv`
-   `osrm__road_distance__static.csv`

## Data quality and limitations

| Issue | Detail |
|----|----|
| **Duplicate zone names** | Two names each appear twice in the shapefile: **Bili** and **Lubunga** (four rows, two unique labels). The CSV contains separate rows with identical names but **different** values. Do not rely on name-only indexing; use `ZSCode` from the shapefile for unambiguous joins. |
| **`row.names` in R** | `read.csv(..., row.names = 1)` will fail or drop rows because of duplicate names. Prefer reading the first column explicitly and keeping a shapefile-based ID, or use `check.names = FALSE` without `row.names`. |
| **Idjwi** | The zone **Idjwi** (island in Lake Kivu) has **518 missing** values in the time matrix—likely because the public OSRM **car** network does not connect the island to the mainland in the extracted graph. Treat Idjwi-related flows with caution or impute separately. |
| **Other `NA` cells** | Aside from Idjwi, most zones have a single missing value (often corresponding to failed pairs involving Idjwi or API errors). Failed batches are logged in the console and left as `NA`. |
| **Coverage** | Values span roughly **0–4,342 minutes** (\~72 h) and **0–4,118 km** road distance for the longest cross-country pairs in the current extract. |
| **Public API** | Re-running the script may yield slightly different results if OSM/OSRM data are updated. Heavy use may trigger rate limiting (`429`); the script sleeps 1 s between batches to mitigate this. |

## Provenance

-   **Geometry:** `data/shapefiles/DRC_Health_zones.shp` (see `data/shapefiles/README.md`).
-   **Routing engine:** [OSRM](http://project-osrm.org/) via the [`osrm`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=osrm) R package (`osrmTable`, `car` profile).
-   **Metadata:** `metadata.yaml`.
